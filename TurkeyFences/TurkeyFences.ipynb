    "This project pulls student meeting attendance data from a csv file, generates the values for the quartile ranges, and outputs outliers per week to the console in text format. This project relies on solely the CSV module and uses the Python standard library for all calculations. The functions defined within this project were designed for the given data set. To accomdate for other data sets, changes would need to be made to the quartile functions for different sized lists of data.\n",
